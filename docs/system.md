# System

`chunkie.system` owns high-level boundary integral equation workflows:

- density storage and solver-vector layout,
- layer potentials,
- traces and jump terms,
- equations and constraints,
- block layout,
- matrix assembly,
- corrections,
- solves,
- and field evaluation.

Jump terms are trace metadata, not hidden kernel behavior. The first convenience
system is the Laplace exterior Dirichlet formulation:

```text
(+0.5 I + D) sigma = boundary_data
u(x) = D[sigma](x)
```

Current implementation status: density layout and system records are active
scaffolding; dense assembly and analytic solve tests follow the geometry and
kernel baseline.
